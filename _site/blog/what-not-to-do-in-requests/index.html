<h2 id="what-not-to-do-in-couchsurfing-requests">What Not to Do in Couchsurfing Requests</h2>

<p>Before diving into good requests, let‚Äôs look at some really bad requests and some mediocre requests. 
<em>These are not requests I‚Äôve written but ones that I‚Äôve received in real life.</em></p>

<h2 id="examples-the-worst-requests">Examples: The Worst Requests</h2>

<h3 id="example-i">Example I</h3>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Hello Neha,
I am a Phd student at Oxford, unfortunately I dont have a place to stay for the following days (because my life is a disaster right now) and the office is not comfortable enough :p</p>

    <p>Best
Alfonso</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<hr>
<h3 id="example-ii">Example II</h3>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Hi Neha!</p>

    <p>Me and a friend of mine are visiting England and we are looking for a place to sleep on monday‚Äôs evening in Oxford !</p>

    <p>Could you help us ? =P</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Requests of this type usually have the same things in common: they‚Äôre ‚Äúcopy and paste‚Äù not personalized, and sadly, approach Couchsurfing as a hotel-type service.</strong></p>

<p>Couchsurfing embraces meeting new people, sharing cultures, learning from each other. So it‚Äôs never, ever effective to message a surfer simply asking for a place to sleep. At it‚Äôs heart, Couchsurfing is about engaging with people, not about sleeping for free. These requests are usually tossed aside or never replied to. To avoid this, invest time in personalizing your requests, and talk about your interest in meeting and learning from each other.</p>

<h2 id="examples-mediocre-requests">Examples: Mediocre Requests</h2>

<h3 id="example-i-1">Example I</h3>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Hi Neha !</p>

    <p>We are two french students, Doriane &amp; Pierre, and we‚Äôre travelling around UK for one month:)</p>

    <p>We would like discover Oxford from 26/08 to 27/08 and we would like meet some locals because it‚Äôs the opportunity for us to experience UK in the eyes of a local.</p>

    <p>We‚Äôre sorry ; we haven‚Äôt favorite movies because theire are too many great films !!</p>

    <p>We don‚Äôt speak English very well but it‚Äôs for us a good opening to progress ; )</p>

    <p>Thanks for your answer !</p>

    <p>Pierre &amp; Doriane</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="example-ii-1">Example II</h3>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Hey Neha!</p>

    <p>Love your profile. Positive psychology? I wish I studied that!</p>

    <p>So I‚Äôm a Peace Corps volunteers who has been serving in a small, desert town in Morocco for the past 20 months. I‚Äôm traveling to France with my aunt mid-Sept, and on the way back to Morocco I thought to make a pit stop in Oxford to see the Bodleain library :-). It‚Äôs been a dream of mine to walk around Oxford University‚Äôs campus and amble inside its libraries, so I really hope that I can do this for a day!</p>

    <p>It would be lovely to spend two nights with you‚Äì on the 26th I fly out at 16:30 from London, so I‚Äôll leave pretty early that day.</p>

    <p>How does that sound?</p>

    <p>Thanks! üôÇ</p>

    <p>‚ÄìDrea</p>

  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="example-iii">Example III</h3>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Hi Neha,</p>

    <p>My name is Alex I am a German physics student, and I‚Äôll work on my Master Disertation (one year), beginning in September. I use the profile of my girlfriend and me but I will travel alone. Unfortunately, it is very very hard to find an accomodation in Oxford when you can‚Äôt visit the rooms :-(. That‚Äôs I would need for the first nights an accomodation.</p>

    <p>I have already studied in England (York) as an Erasmus student last year and enjoyed my time very much. That‚Äôs why I have decided to come back to the UK for one more year. If I were to choose a few things to describe my interests, I‚Äôd say I like to do sports, I enjoy travelling/new cultures and meeting new people (I am very curious).</p>

    <p>I think my friends would describe me that I am clean, respectful of other spaces, reliable, sociable and willing to share experience.</p>

    <p>It would be very cool if I could sleep some nights at your flat (but not more than 2-3 nights).</p>

    <p>Cheers,
Alex</p>

<h3 id="the-good-elements">The Good Elements</h3>

<p>All of the requests seem to give some indication that they‚Äôve read my profile. That‚Äôs a good sign!</p>

<h3 id="the-bad-elements">The Bad Elements</h3>

<p>Overall, all of these requests are <em>‚Äòcopy and paste‚Äô</em> requests, which most hosts hate receiving. They simply aren‚Äôt personalized enough. Additionally, she would do well in focusing less on herself, and rather, the person she‚Äôs appealing to. A fantastic fix would be to point out what she can offer the host, what she finds fascinating about the host, or what she can teach the host, before talking about what the host can do for her.</p>

<p>These types of requests are basically <em>okay</em> ‚Äì and nothing more than that. If I was fully free that day, I would likely accept them. But there‚Äôs nothing compelling about these requests that would make me choose it over other requests and surely nothing compelling that would make me try and accept these guests if I had a conflict.</p>

<p>With these types of requests, you have a 50/50% chance of getting hosted ‚Äì perhaps more if you‚Äôre visiting a less touristy location and surely less if you‚Äôre visiting a touristy location.</p>

<p>With the examples of bad requests behind us, let‚Äôs talk about how to do it properly.</p>
