<h2 id="the-passion-hypothesis">The Passion Hypothesis</h2>

<p>We’re all fairly familiar with the passion hypothesis:</p>

<p><strong>Passion Hypothesis</strong> — the notion that the perfect job/career trajectory exists and the path there is to first identify what one is passionate about and then pursue it.</p>

<p>The appeal of the passion hypothesis is fairly intuitive; after all, why wouldn’t someone want to do what she loves? The case for the passion hypothesis culminates with the fact that every job is difficult and time consuming, and thus, you might as well do what you love.</p>

<p>From college graduation speeches to every Hallmark graduation card ever made, ‘follow your passion’ <em>is</em> the hallmark of career advice.</p>

<p>However, the ‘follow your passion’ advice has a number of pitfalls. Many of these elements are highlighted by Cal Newport’s book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1455509124/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1455509124&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=amazon05b3-20&amp;linkId=f9237c07380551d2e25ff3b638ef4897" target="_blank">So Good They Can’t Ignore You</a>, which I’d highly recommend reading.</p>

<p>Below I’ve highlighted 6 key flaws of the ‘passion hypothesis’ which often go overlooked.</p>

<h3 id="problem-1-being-passionate-about-a-skill-is-an-entirely-different-issue-than-surviving-the-rigor-of-that-skill">Problem 1: Being ‘passionate’ about a skill is an entirely different issue than surviving the rigor of that skill.</h3>

<p>It’s easy to tell someone “I am passionate about <strong><em>X</em></strong>”.</p>

<p>But it’s harder to identify underlying characteristics and situations which allowed that person to distinguish themselves from the other 5 million people equally passionate about topic X.</p>

<p>And perhaps if we do identify those other characteristics - grit, tenacity, the importance of personal connections - they simply don’t ‘stick’ as career advice as strongly as ‘follow your passion’ does.</p>

<p>While it’s easy to ‘follow one’s passion’ - it’s much harder to slave away at practice or ace the MCATs – so we’re left with people passionate about a particular area without the qualifications and characteristics to succeed in that skill.</p>

<p>In 2006, for example, 60% of Johns Hopkins University undergraduates indicated an interest in pursuing a STEM related field. Four years later, only about half of those who wanted a stem degree succeeded in achieving one.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, prestigious occupations like consulting and finance have hoards of students passionate about the career, with only a select few who have cultivated the skills and training to get the job itself. McKinsey, a top tier consulting firm, receives 50,000 applicants a year and hire 1-3k consultants per year (a ~4% acceptance rate). What happens to the other 47,000 applicants?</p>

<p>Or more generally, what happens when passion simply isn’t enough? Perhaps the focus shouldn’t be on a nebulous notion of ‘passion’ but rather on other more concrete factors and character qualities – grit, emotional intelligence, teamwork skills, ability to network, etc.</p>

<h3 id="problem-2-career-passions-are-rare-and-market-demand-is-a-powerful-force">Problem 2: Career passions are rare and market demand is a powerful force</h3>

<p>No one ever says they’re passionate about legal investigation. Most people point to activities like sports, singing, dancing, etc., and it’s this precise sector that has the largest dearth of jobs.</p>

<p>The less likely someone is to pay for your skill the harder it becomes to support yourself with that skill, no matter your degree of expertise. Naturally this doesn’t mean it’s impossible; professional dancers exist as do companies which employ historians.</p>

<p><strong>But it simply means the odds are statistically stacked against your favor, and other character qualities, like grit, hard work, and personal connections all become vitally crucial.</strong> You may have to out-skill many more people , have specific personal connections in the industry (example: Hollywood), or simply work incredibly, incredibly hard (example: professional sports), etc.,).</p>

<p>Which brings us to the next problem. . .</p>

<h3 id="problem-3-passions-change-and-are-hard-to-pin-down">Problem 3: Passions change and are hard to pin down</h3>

<p>If that isn’t enough, passions change over time and are particularly hard to pin down right out of college when one has little experience in the real world. These interests take time to develop and cultivate.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/05/jobs/graduating-and-looking-for-your-passion-just-be-patient.html?mcubz=3" target="_blank">Researcher, Angela Duckworth writes:</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>“Young graduates might imagine that discovering your passion happens the way it does in a movie: with a flash of insight and a trumpet blast. Before that flash, you were struggling to find yourself, and in the next moment, you know exactly who you were meant to be.</p>

    <p>As a psychologist who studies world-class achievers, I can say the reality of following your passion is not very romantic. It takes time to develop a direction that feels so in-the-bones right that you never want to veer from it.</p>

    <p>Don’t panic if you can’t think of a career path that’s a perfect fit. In large part, this is because interests are not just discovered, they’re developed. Scientists have learned that the sort of enduring fascination that commencement speakers like to praise usually takes time and experience to bloom fully.”</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="problem-4-most-of-us-have-a-very-limited-purview-of-available-jobs">Problem 4: Most of us have a very limited purview of available jobs</h3>

<p>Ask a kid which jobs exist, and he’ll likely be able to list 10, 20, 40 tops. Doctor, lawyer, engineer, consultant. What about an industrial engineer? Or an appeals reviewer?</p>

<p>Not only do we not know of the majority of existing jobs, but we have little knowledge of what they entail and therefore do not consider them in the scope of jobs we consider for ourselves.</p>

<p>This results in a set of problems:</p>

<ul>
  <li>We are unaware of over 90% of jobs that exist.</li>
  <li>We are unaware of the qualifications of the role, the lifestyle it entails, the personality best suited for it and a myriad of other information regarding those jobs.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is important because . . .</p>

<h3 id="problem-5-we-like-jobs-for-more-nuanced-reasons-than-innate-interests">Problem 5: We like jobs for more nuanced reasons than innate interests</h3>

<p>Research shows there are many elements which lead us to enjoy our jobs. 
<a href="https://80000hours.org/articles/dont-follow-your-passion/" target="_blank">As 80,000 hours puts it</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>“If a basketball fan gets a job involving basketball, but works with people they hate, receives unfair pay, or finds the work meaningless, they are still going to dislike their job.”</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>According to <a href="https://80000hours.org/articles/dont-follow-your-passion/" target="_blank">80,000 hours</a>, the 6 elements needed for job satisfaction include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Engaging work</li>
  <li>Work which helps others</li>
  <li>Being good at your job</li>
  <li>Supportive colleagues</li>
  <li>Basic needs</li>
  <li>Fit with the rest of your life</li>
</ul>

<p>Meanwhile, career expert, Cal Newport argues the 3 most important elements in job satisfaction are:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Mastery – The feeling you’re good at what you do.</li>
  <li>Autonomy – The feeling of having control over your day and actions.</li>
  <li>Purpose &amp; Relatedness – The feeling of connection to other people and a desire to make a contribution.</li>
</ol>

<p>Suffice to say, the formula for job satisfaction encompasses far more than one’s passion for a job.</p>

<h3 id="problem-6-the-passion-hypothesis-tends-to-cast-too-much-focus-on-the-destination-and-not-enough-on-the-journey-and-environment-there">Problem 6: The passion hypothesis tends to cast too much focus on the destination and not enough on the journey and environment there.</h3>

<p>Often when we imagine ourselves in a position – dancing, serving as a CEO, serving as a doctor – we imagine the camera-facing view without the underlying annoyances. Perhaps we imagine the prestige of serving as a professor in a top tier institution, without considering the constant expectation of searching for grant funding and underlying academic politics. Consider Tim Westergren (founder of Pandora)’s <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-does-it-feel-like-being-the-CEO-of-a-startup#!n=18" target="_blank">take on serving as a founder/ CEO of a startup</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>In my mind, the most distinctive characteristic of that job is the constant seesaw of worry and euphoria.  There is nothing so frightening as looking over the edge, and nothing so exhilarating as making it over a hump. You climb a wall of worry almost everyday, but you also experience highs like you’ve never felt before. It can jangle the nerves (I had chronic insomnia for months), but it is tremendously fulfilling. I suppose that’s logical.  The best stuff never comes easy.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>Perhaps we imagine the prestige of serving as a successful CEO without considering our ability to manage the other less salient elements – the constant state of uncertainty, insomnia, and pressure from investors.</p>

<p>As such our view of what we’re passionate about is biased towards the good and away from the bad, such that our perception of our happiness of a given profession is strongly off mark.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Given these pitfalls of the passion hypothesis, it’s clear job satisfaction is far more nuanced than a matter of simply following one’s passion.</p>
