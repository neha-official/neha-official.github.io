<p>Hardcore planners like myself find it very unnerving not planning 2 years, 5 years, 10 years down the road. And yet, what is the use of planning so far ahead when our perception on what we want to do changes every 3-5 years?</p>

<p>Reid Hoffman, founder of LinkedIn points out:</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>“Sure, Bill Clinton decided on politics at age sixteen, and set his sights on the presidency almost as young. But most of us zig and zag our way through life. Tony Blair spent a year trying to make a go of it as a rock music promoter before entering politics. Jerry Springer was mayor of Cincinnati before attaining daytime television fame. Andrea Bocelli practiced law before he became a world-famous singer.  Winning careers, like winning start-ups, are in permanent beta: always a work in progress.”</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>Meanwhile, Sheryl Sandberg, current COO of Facebook points out that, had she mapped out her entire career from the start, she would have missed working at both Google and Facebook; after all, when she graduated from Harvard, as <a href="https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/insights/sheryl-sandberg-develop-your-voice-not-your-brand?utm_source=facebook&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=stripes&amp;utm_content=08052017&amp;utm_source=FBPAGE&amp;utm_medium=Social&amp;utm_campaign=Insights&amp;Date=20170805&amp;linkId=40402833" target="_blank">this article</a> points out, Facebook hadn’t existed yet.</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Sheryl Sandberg: “If you try to plan out your career, it’s going to be boring. You’re going to miss all the good stuff, because all the good stuff hasn’t been invented yet”. “You want to have a really long-run dream and you want to have a short-run plan. And that short-run plan, it’s not about what you accomplish, especially in the early days. It’s about what you help other people accomplish and about what you learn. You invest in yourself. You invest in the success of your teams.”</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>Jeff Goins, author of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0718022076/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0718022076&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=amazon05b3-20&amp;linkId=fca6114f2ea8714d7e7f0f7a31891613" target="_blank">The Art of Work</a>, argues:</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>“Finding your purpose is more of a path than a plan: it involves twists and turns that you never expected. Ultimately these surprises lead you to your destiny. And once you arrive at what you thought was the destination, you realize it’s only another leg in the journey.”</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>In other words, a career is the <strong>sum path of individual inflection points</strong> – or in other words, the vector that arises from connecting the different jobs we take on. In that way, it’s un-plannable; how do you plan the people you’ll meet that will offer you jobs? Or how do you plan the realizations you’ll make as you progress through jobs, which end up affecting which jobs you take and which jobs you don’t? In that sense, career planning is unplannable in the traditional sense, but fully plannable in a more flexible way.</p>

<p>Here, I’ll point out the two most useful models of career planning I’ve come across: that of Keith Ferrazzi and that of Reid Hoffman.</p>

<h2 id="the-mission--goal-oriented-model--keith-ferrazzi">The Mission &amp; Goal Oriented Model | Keith Ferrazzi</h2>

<p>In <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0385346654/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0385346654&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=amazon05b3-20&amp;linkId=47ffa9b6bd24b7724878e004eb592405" target="_blank">Never Eat Alone</a>, Ferrazzi argues the more specific we are about our goals, the easier it becomes to strategize around it and develop meaningful relationships relevant to the goal at hand. He points to a study which asked Yale’s class of 1953 a number of questions regarding goals, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have you set goals?</li>
  <li>Have you written them down?</li>
  <li>Do you have a plan to accomplish them?</li>
</ul>

<p>In 1973, when the same class was resurveyed:</p>
<ul>
  <li>13% who had goals but hadn’t written them down earned <em>twice</em> as much as the 84% who had no specific goals at all.</li>
  <li>The 3% who <em>had</em> written their goals down were earning, on average ten times as much as the other 97% of graduates combined.</li>
</ul>

<p>Make of that, what you will. Ferrazzi recommends using a plan which involves:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Setting a goal three years out and adapting the plan as one’s situation and goals change.</li>
  <li>Each year has a set of two smaller goals to accomplish within that time frame (A &amp; B goals).</li>
  <li>If you’re a massive planner, you can create 3 month goals within those periods to focus and drive your efforts.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-entrepreneurial-approach--reid-hoffman-founder-of-linkedin">The Entrepreneurial Approach | Reid Hoffman (Founder of LinkedIn)</h2>

<p>Hoffman highlights a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20121023063237-1213-flexibly-persistent-career-planning-it-s-not-about-the-color-of-your-parachute" target="_blank">Plan A, Plan B, and Plan Z model</a>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Plan A - Current plan, your current job, your current thesis about how you stand out in the marketplace.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Plan B - What you pivot to in light of a new opportunity with more potential than your current plan. This can go into effect if Plan A isn’t working <em>or</em> if Plan A is working but Plan B appears to have more potential.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Hoffman argues, <em>“the best Plan B’s are different but related to what you are doing now; this way you can apply the lessons you’ve learned to date to the new plan”.</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>Plan Z - the worst-case plan. This defines and allows you to take on uncertainty and risk in your career.</li>
</ul>

<p>Both of these methods highlight a concept of <em>flexible planning</em> – allowing one to be goal-oriented but still responsive to environmental opportunities and conditions.</p>
