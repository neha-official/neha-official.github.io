Me in the Gangnam district in South Korea! Yes, I did the Gangnam Style dance there, and no, I will not be posting that. ðŸ˜›

</div>

At Oxford, I once played underwater hockey which is about as crazy as it sounds. This is me before the game. It's literally played on the floor of a pool, about 10 feet down with scuba equipment. The scuba equipment is so that you can watch the game while recovering your breath but the actual play is on the pool floor. When you're back in play, you sort of dive down and get into the game --- this is [what it looks like under the water](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAukrpTEvZA){:target="_blank"}.

</div>

In 2015, I visited Dublin, Ireland on St. Patrick's Day. Yep, and it was as insane as that sounded, and more. 

If you could imagine an entire city erupting in a party for 3 consecutive nights, that's more or less what St. Patrick's Day is like in Ireland's capital city. These were some of the crowds during the festival.

  <img src="/images/photos-travel/8-paris.jpg" width="700">
</div>

This photo above of the [Arc de Triomphe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arc_de_Triomphe){:target="_blank"} is by far, one of my favorite photos. I had taken a bus (from Brussels, I think?) to Paris, but of course, it arrived _ridiculously_ early in the morning --- around 6 am or so. And so I sort of shrugged, and figured I'd visit the Eiffel Tower, because, well, why not. On the way, I passed by this beauty, caught right as the sun was rising.

</div>

This was the 2016 New Year in Burma! As explained [here](http://www.123newyear.com/newyear-traditions/buddhist.html){:target="_blank"}:

> "According to Buddhist traditions, no celebrations or festivals are considered to be complete until and unless one lights up candles in the temples and monasteries, as doing so is considered to be a symbol of showing love and respect to the blessed souls and to the supreme power. Also, it is considered to bless petitioner with good luck and happiness for the coming time. The same goes for New Year celebrations as well. On New Year day, people in Buddhist countries make a visit to temples and monasteries, bath Buddha statues, offer prayers and worship to Lord Buddha, and call for getting conferred with happy and peaceful times ahead."

<div align="center">
  <img src="/images/photos-travel/3-canoe.jpg" width="700">
</div>

This is us canoe polo-ing, which, believe it or not, is a [thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPmxXt47XJU){:target="_blank"}. It's literally playing polo while canoeing. The picture below is me tipping over in the canoe --- it's actually incredibly hard to stay stable while trying to move forward with the ball. That whole week I was afraid some sort of swamp worm would have infected me.

My Tokyo host above was _amazing_. He not only let me stay at his place for almost a week but also cooked me an _amazing_ traditional Japanese dinner.

<div align="center">
  <img src="/images/photos-travel/11-czech.jpg" width="400">
</div>

In the Czech Republic, it was so interesting to see kids casually walking the streets alone --- such a different cultural take than the American view of 'kids walking alone is incredibly dangerous'.

-------

<div align="center">
  <img src="/images/photos-travel/shwedagon.jpg" width="700">
</div>

This is the [Shwedagon Pagoda](https://www.google.gr/search?q=shwedagon+pagoda&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjCuaLYxu_VAhWqD8AKHQ2mBacQ_AUICigB&biw=701&bih=736){:target="_blank"}, in Burma. Even after 28+ countries, the Shwedagon Pagoda is by far, the most impressive religious structure I've _ever_ seen --- far more impressive than even [St. Peter's Basilica](https://www.google.gr/search?biw=701&bih=696&tbm=isch&sa=1&q=st.+peter%27s+basilica&oq=st.+peter%27s+bas&gs_l=psy-ab.3.0.0j0i30k1l3.55474.57301.0.58136.15.12.0.0.0.0.241.1305.0j7j1.8.0....0...1.1.64.psy-ab..7.8.1304...0i67k1.NHKf5NUWoLM){:target="_blank"}. It's simply absolutely _stunning_.

<div align="center">
  <img src="/images/photos-travel/chang-rai.jpg" width="700">
</div>

This is [Wat Rong Khun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wat_Rong_Khun){:target="_blank"} in Chang Rai, Thailand. The entire structure is symbolic of Buddhist philosophy. As explained by Wikipedia:

> > "The main building at the white temple, the ubosot, is reached by crossing a bridge, "the cycle of rebirth", over a small lake. In front of the bridge are hundreds of outreaching hands that symbolize unrestrained desire. The bridge proclaims that the way to happiness is by foregoing temptation, greed, and desire."

</div>

This was a mountain I climbed in Scotland which would have been an awesome hike, had it not started snowing and hailing _super_ hard halfway up. Suffice to say, I still made it up and back down without dying. 

Below is an image of the mountain from afar.

</div>

This was _the best_ pastry shop I've ever been to, in Madrid, Spain. Cakes and pastries to die for.

I believe it was [La Mallorquina](https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Restaurant_Review-g187514-d2071743-Reviews-La_Mallorquina-Madrid.html){:target="_blank"} that we went to, but I guess I'll have to re-visit to be 100% sure. ðŸ˜›

<div align="center">
  <img src="/images/photos-travel/1-bigbang.jpg" width="700">
</div>

You've probably seen me wear this. A lot :P

Big Bang is probably the only artist I've ever had a super strong allegiance to, so naturally, I made it a mission to get a hat with BigBang's logo in South Korea. 

But lo and behold, after about a week of searching I _could not_ find a hat with a simple BigBang logo on it --- even in Myeongdong, the mecca for all things K-pop. 

So a couple weeks later, I ended up getting one made in Bangkok, Thailand, where it costs about $12 to make a custom hat. SO that's the origin story of this hat. Only $12 of value, but took a great deal of effort to make :P

Big Bang concert! I ended up sneaking up to the front to see them a bit closer + had a camera with _epic_ zoom, resulting in this awesome photo. ðŸ˜Š
