## About the Site

Hi! My name is Neha. This is my brain space - my tabula rasa for random thoughts.

In September 2015, I published [The Official Couchsurfing Guide](https://www.nehakay.com/couchsurfing-guide) which went viral within the Couchsurfing community. 

Now, back to a modest 10-20 daily visitors, I focus on updating the blog with my thoughts on travel, organization, career exploration, and life perspective. 

Welcome, have fun, and if you see something you like, feel free to email me (<nehakay8@gmail.com>). I live in Dallas, TX + love meeting people so if you're in the area, reach out.

## About Me

### I spend a lot of time thinking about

__Personal Development__ -- I consider myself a constantly evolving piece of software - continually identifying the bugs and feature implementations I can add to myself and the million things I have yet to learn. Reid Hoffman terms this state ‚Äúpermanent beta‚Äù, which I *entirely* identify with.

Sometimes a feature gets added and the whole thing blows up (cue Stack Overflow), but for the most part, it‚Äôs worked out pretty well. I can't imagine not being obsessed about personal development, what I can learn, and how I can improve; it comes with its ups and downs but for the most part, I'm incredibly proud of how far I've come and more importantly, how much further I have to go from here.

__Optimizing / Engineering Life__ . . .as opposed to simply letting it happen.

__Future Plans / Future Trajectory__ . . . or in other words, how to maximize the impact and value I provide in my chosen career path.

### I'm generally described as
* Cheerful
* Playful
* Analytical
* High-energy
* Giving
* "Spreadsheet-oriented" 
* "Data-driven" 

I used to joke that I have basically no social life, but I don't think that's entirely true (anymore). My close friends and family mean the world to me. If we've ever videochatted, hung out at a board game night, or spent time together in person, you know I'm referring to you. 

### What I'm Doing With My Life

I studied at Johns Hopkins University as a double major, double minor, mostly focusing on Economics and Computer Science. Also studied at Oxford University as a visiting student in 2014 and 2015.

Like most people, I had generally no clue as to what I'd want to do in the future, beyond wanting to build on my technical skill. I researched a ton and even documented my research as a [career guide]({% post_url 2016-06-19-the-career-guide %}){:target="_blank"} before hitting the university fall recruiting season in full force. 

I was lucky enough to receive 8 job offers in the fall with companies probably far too good for me -- Deloitte, Booz Allen Hamilton, Prudential, Teach for America, Bloomberg, etc., before finally choosing to work at Microsoft in February 2018.

In any case, even after all of that, I still have no clue what I want to do in the future - you know, from a long-term perspective. But I'm open-minded, driven, and ready to put in the time if I see or create something valuable.
