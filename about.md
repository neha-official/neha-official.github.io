## About the Site

Hi! My name is Neha. This is my brain space - my tabula rasa for random thoughts.

In September 2015, I published [The Official Couchsurfing Guide](https://www.nehakay.com/couchsurfing-guide) which went viral within the Couchsurfing community. Now, back to a modest 10-20 daily visitors, I focus on updating the blog with my thoughts on career exploration, organization, entrepreneurship, and positive psychology. The website is mostly a place for me to share my thoughts, in the event others like me will find them useful.

Welcome, have fun, and if you see something you like, feel free to email me! (<neha@nehakay.com>).

## About Me

### I'm generally described as . . . 
* Cheerful
* Playful
* Analytical
* High-energy
* Giving
* "Spreadsheet-oriented" 
* "Data-driven" 

I used to joke that I have basically no social life, but I don't think that's entirely true (anymore). My close friends and family mean the world to me. If we've ever videochatted, hung out at a board game night, or spent time together in person, you know I'm referring to you. 

### I spend a lot of time thinking about . . .

__Personal Development__

I consider myself a constantly evolving piece of software - continually identifying the bugs and feature implementations I can add to myself and the million things I have yet to learn. Reid Hoffman terms this state ‚Äúpermanent beta‚Äù, which I *entirely* identify with.

Sometimes a feature gets added and the whole thing blows up (cue Stack Overflow), but for the most part, it‚Äôs worked out pretty well. I can't imagine not being obsessed about personal development, what I can learn, and how I can improve; it comes with its ups and downs but for the most part, I'm incredibly proud of how far I've come and more importantly, how much further I have to go from here.

__Optimizing / Engineering Life__

. . .as opposed to simply letting it happen.

__Future Plans / Future Trajectory__

. . . or in other words, how to maximize the impact and value I provide in my chosen career path.

### 10 things I could never do without . . .

- The Internet and its endless production of knowledge

### What I'm Doing With My Life

I studied at Johns Hopkins as a double major, double minor, majoring in Economics & Psychology and minoring in Computer Science and Entrepreneurship & Management. Also studied at Oxford University as a visiting student in 2014 and 2015.

Like most people, I had generally no clue as to what I'd want to do in the future, beyond wanting to gain technical skill. I researched a ton and even documented my research as a [career guide]({% post_url 2016-06-19-the-career-guide %}){:target="_blank"} before hitting the college fall recruiting season in full force. 

I was lucky enough to receive 8 job offers in the fall with companies probably far too good for me -- Deloitte, Booz Allen Hamilton, Prudential, Teach for America, Bloomberg, etc., before finally choosing to work at Microsoft in February 2018.

In any case, from a long-term perspective, even after all of that, I still have no clue what I want to do in the future. But I'm open-minded, driven, and ready to put in the time if I see or create something valuable.

### In my free time I . . . 

* Rant about Apple products.
* Rant about Chipotle.
* Videochat with friends.
* Spend embarrassing amounts of time on my computer (shout out to Reem for pointing this out).
* Travel.

As of August 2017, I've [traveled to 28 countries]({% post_url 2017-06-02-footsteps %}){:target="_blank"} and will be traveling to the last few countries I want to see before settling down and starting work at Microsoft.
